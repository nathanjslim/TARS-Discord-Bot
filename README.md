# TARS-Discord-Bot

This was one of the first projects I did with Python. 
TARS is the name of one of the tactial robots from the movie *Interstellar*; one of his more unqiue and distinct features was his sarcasm and humour settings. 

My original goal for this Discord Bot was to allow users to have a conversation with it where TARS would respond accordingly to his settings.
This was much more difficult than I had anticipated and thus settled for a helpful **quote API** using ZenQuotes.
